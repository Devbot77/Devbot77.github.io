This is the blog of **Devin**. Created on Github, built with Jekyll, and devoted to all things development. I spent the last few years working as an IT project manager and after getting laid off, decided it was time to make that change to software development that I'd been wanting to do for quite some time now. Having been interested in programming since I was young, I'm excited to finally devote the resources to fulfilling this dream. Although this was started for my work with The Firehose Project, I'm looking forward to chronicling my journal down the rabbit hole. You're welcome to join! Also, you can visit my github [here](https://github.com/Devbot77) if you're too lazy to navigate to the footer. 

Allons-y!
